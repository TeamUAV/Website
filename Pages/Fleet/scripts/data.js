      "The aircraft is a 700mm wing span micro-class RC aircraft equipped with 10W full-bodied stereo realised through dual high-performance drivers to produce enhanced bass, soft, clearand dynamic sound, it also consists an FPV camera for 1080P HD surveillance. Vaayu is used as an emergency response system, the sole purpose of making this aircraft is to provide an emergency evacuation warning to people just before floods. Also, the same system can be used to guide people to the exact location of resources like food, clothing and shelter after floods, it can be used to check upon poaching, forest fires and landslides. By taking real-life situation of floods in Kerala we have taken stimulations how our aircraft will work before and aftermath of floods in a remote village and also explained how our aircraft has the best possible design and technology.",

A gimbal camera mounted in the lower part of the aircraft can be used for an aerial view and has excellent surveillance and facial recognition potential. The model has a special fuselage compartment divided into two parts. The top part consists of all the avionics needed for the aircraft, and the bottom part, which has easy and quick access through a removable and openable cover, is solely for the payload and the camera. It is a very stable and highly maneuverable aircraft. With a wingspan of 2100mm, this flying model is designed specifically for long flying and a high load capability. Skua is an exceptional product for delivery and professional FPV purposes.",
